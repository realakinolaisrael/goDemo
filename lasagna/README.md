I picked up a challenge on excersim on package lasagna.

Here's the break down of the Program

Instruction:

Task 1 - Define the OvenTime constant with how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is 40.
 OvenTime 
 // => 40

 Task 2 - Define the RemainingOvenTime() that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a parameter and returns how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the expected oven time in minutess from the previous task.

 Task 3 - Calculate the Preparation time in minutes 

 Task 4 - Calculate the Elapsed working time in minutes
